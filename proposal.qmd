# Proposal

Your proposal should include:

* A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. (Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.)
* The reason why you chose this dataset.
* The two questions you want to answer.
  + A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).
